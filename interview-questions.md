# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: It is a snapshot of the object in a class

  Researched answer: The instance variable is an object in a class with a local scope. 



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: I assumed it was a block of code in Ruby. 

  Researched answer: A ruby block acts similarly to a method but without a name, which offers liberties that js methods can't offer.
  " a block is an anonymous piece of code, it can accept input in form of arguments (if it needs any), and it will return a value, but it does not have a name."



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: I do not know.

  Researched answer: implicit return is a behaviour that results in the output of a method returning the last line of code



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: I'm not entirely sure what this means and difference between the two terms but I imagine that object oriented programming is self explanatory, in that the program is centered on objects, whereas functional programming is centered on functions.

  Researched answer: Ruby is an example of object oriented programing as it processes every value as an object. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. 



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: class is a blueprint for objects. Objects are passed through classes.

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint for objects that also determines object behaviour. An object is a datatype or an "instance" of a class. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- PostgreSQL: is an open source object-relational database management system
SQL: Structured Query Language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system
- API: An application programming interface is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc.
- CRUD: is a computer science acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources. This acronym is useful for the constructions of APIs and their functionality.
- Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is a web framework that makes it easy to build powerful web apps in a short amount of time. Ruby on Rails is written in the Ruby programming language.
- ORM: Object-relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.
- Active Record:"In software engineering, the active record pattern is an architectural pattern found in software that stores in-memory object data in relational databases. "
